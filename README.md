Emotions are considered of utmost importance as they have a key responsibility in human interaction. Nowadays, social media plays a pivotal role in the interaction of people all across the world. However, sentiment analysis for Twitter messages is regarded as a challenging problem because tweets are short and informal. With the use of Recurrent Neural Networks, a model is created and trained to learn to recognize emotions in tweets. The dataset has thousands of tweets each classified in one of 6 emotions love, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and anger.
